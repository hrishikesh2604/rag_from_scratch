# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Project

## Project Structure

The project contains **five separate files**, each implementing an independent approach to **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. Each file highlights a unique method for document retrieval and response generation:

1. **First Notebook**: Basic RAG implementation.
2. **Second Notebook**: RAG using Query Fusion and HYDE.
3. **Third Notebook**: RAG with Semantic Routing and Query Construction using Metadata Filters.
4. **Fourth Notebook**: RAG using Multi-Representation Indexing, RAPTOR, and ColBERT.
5. **Fifth Notebook**: Multi-query Representation with Re-Ranking.

## What is RAG?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** combines document retrieval with generative models to provide more accurate, contextually relevant answers. Instead of relying solely on a model's training data for generating responses, RAG retrieves relevant documents based on a query and uses them to enhance the generation process. This method improves factual accuracy and adaptability, making models more useful for answering specific and complex questions.

## Technologies Used:
- **Langchain**: A framework for building language model applications that integrates document retrieval and generation.
- **Langsmith**: A platform for monitoring and managing language model performance.
- **OpenAI API**: Used to interact with large language models for text generation and embeddings.
- **ChromaDB**: A vector database used to store and search embeddings, enabling efficient document retrieval.

## File-by-File Breakdown

### 1. **Basic RAG Approach (Notebook 1)**
   - **Description**: Implements a simple RAG pipeline using document indexing and embedding generation. Similarity scores are calculated between the query and documents to retrieve the top-k relevant ones.
   - **Steps**:
     - Index documents.
     - Generate embeddings for documents and queries.
     - Calculate similarity scores to retrieve relevant documents.
   - **Key Concepts**: Document embedding, similarity search, top-k retrieval.

### 2. **RAG using Query Fusion and HYDE (Notebook 2)**
   - **Query Fusion**: Merges multiple variations of a query to improve document retrieval accuracy.
   - **HYDE (Hypothetical Document Generation)**: Generates hypothetical documents based on the query, expanding the retrieval search space.
   - **Workflow**:
     - Fuse multiple query variations.
     - Use HYDE to generate hypothetical documents.
     - Retrieve documents based on the fused query and hypothetical documents.

### 3. **RAG with Semantic Routing and Metadata Filters (Notebook 3)**
   - **Semantic Routing**: Dynamically routes queries based on their semantic content, directing them to different parts of the document corpus.
   - **Metadata Filters**: Filters documents based on metadata (e.g., date, topic) to focus on contextually relevant documents.
   - **Workflow**:
     - Route the query semantically.
     - Apply metadata filters to refine document retrieval.
     - Retrieve relevant documents based on the filtered corpus.

### 4. **Multi-Representation Indexing (RAPTOR & ColBERT) (Notebook 4)**
   - **Multi-Representation Indexing**: Creates multiple representations of each document to capture different facets of the content.
   - **RAPTOR**: A fast retrieval algorithm that leverages these multiple representations for efficient retrieval.
   - **ColBERT (Contextualized Late Interaction)**: Fine-grained similarity matching technique that compares segments of documents and queries for more accurate retrieval.
   - **Workflow**:
     - Index documents using multiple representations.
     - Use RAPTOR for initial retrieval.
     - Apply ColBERT for detailed similarity matching.

### 5. **Re-Ranking Multi-Query Representation (Notebook 5)**
   - **Multi-Query Representation**: Generates multiple representations of the input query to capture different aspects of user intent.
   - **Re-Ranking**: Re-ranks the retrieved documents based on their relevance to multiple query representations.
   - **Workflow**:
     - Generate multiple query representations.
     - Perform initial retrieval.
     - Re-rank results based on multi-query representations.

## Key Highlights:
- **Modularity**: Each notebook demonstrates a different approach to RAG, enabling independent experimentation.
- **Scalability**: Techniques such as semantic routing and multi-representation indexing enhance the system's ability to scale for larger corpora and complex queries.
- **Efficiency**: Optimizations like query fusion, RAPTOR, and re-ranking make the system faster and more accurate.
